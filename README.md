*update....we have decided to create an entirely new project, please visit http://koji.earth

for the development of community project Tosa token


Hello everyone!

I am node_z, and I am just one of the team members from the original Tosa 1.0 community who is working on reviving this project.

After our favorite developer Amanda abandoned the project, a new team took her place and quickly also disappeared a week later, and then
tried to sell us back the domain name to tosa.finance. Haha! If it weren't true I wouldn't believe it ether.

As of March 14th, 2021, here is were we stand:

We have a new team of 5 admins/developers who will be working on reviving TOSA.

Some aspects of the project have already been farmed out to fiverr for like NFT and Token art.

We will be creating a new token contract on BSC and swapping old v1 for v2 tokens. 

We will also have a farming option to farm NFT cards.

Website, Medium, and many other aspects of the project are still being worked on.

We ask everyone in the community to be patient as we all have varying levels of experience and are just trying our best to do the right thing.

Stay tuned!
